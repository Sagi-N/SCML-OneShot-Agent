This module implements a factory manager for the SCM 2021 league of ANAC 2021
competition (one-shot track).
Game Description is available at:
http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2021oneshot.pdf

Your agent can sense and act in the world by calling methods in the AWI it has.
For all properties/methods available only to SCM agents check:
  http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2020docs/api/scml.oneshot.OneShotAWI.html

Documentation, tutorials and other goodies are available at:

To test this template do the following:

0. Let the path to this file be /{path-to-this-file}/myagent.py

1. Install a venv (recommended)
>> python3 -m venv .venv

2. Activate the venv (required if you installed a venv)
On Linux/Mac:
    >> source .venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
    >> \.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

3. Update pip just in case (recommended)

>> pip install -U pip wheel

4. Install SCML

>> pip install scml

5. [Optional] Install last year's agents for STD/COLLUSION tracks only

>> pip install scml-agents

6. Run the script with no parameters (assuming you are )

>> python /{path-to-this-file}/myagent.py

You should see a short tournament running and results reported.

The agent tries to maximize its revenues by constantly keeping track on the average sell price and average buy price it
has so far, and setting the acceptable buy prices and sell prices respectively â€“ Always trying to sell at a price
higher than the average buy price and trying to buy at a price lower than the average sell price
